# apartmentWebsite1.0

https://jasonhao4.github.io/apartmentWebsite/
Originally I didn't have any ideas on what to make a website for to practice what I've learned so far. Then it hit me when my roommate asked me what are we doing for our apartment.
I made this html website as a way to adversite my apartment for fall semester of 2020. Currently I'm learning web development through udemy.
It was fun designing this website, this was before I learned about bootstrap so this is my pre-bootstrap phase.
