# apartmentWebsite1.0

Originally I didn't have any ideas on what to make a website for to practice what I've learned so far. 
Then it hit me when my roommate asked me what are we doing for our apartment.
I made this html website as a way to adversite my apartment for fall semester of 2020.

## Why

I created this website since I wanted to practice what I've learned about web development so far and to have a reference point to see how much I've progressed in the future. This doesn't have bootstrap since I've just learned about how useful bootstrap is. Currently I'm going into my senior year in University of San Francisco as a CS major and haven't had any experience with front end development so I wanted to learn. 

## Future
Hopefully the next website I make will include bootstrap. An idea I have would be to create a website after I've learned more about web development. Not only that but also create two, one with bootstrap 3 and bootstrap 4 since many companies use one or the other. It would be cool to have both html next to each other to see the difference between them.
